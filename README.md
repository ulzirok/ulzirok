## 💡 About Me:
I am a beginner front-end developer with a background in accounting and a degree in Information Technology. Although my university education included limited practical IT training, I’ve always been interested in technology and wanted to switch to IT. After several years of working as an accountant, I decided to follow my passion and start a new career in web development.
